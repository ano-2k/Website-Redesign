JumpBooks Website Redesign

Project Overview:

JumpBooks is a local book-selling platform based in Sri Lanka. In this project, I identified several usability issues on the website and worked on a redesign to improve user experience. The project was carried out in multiple stages: selecting the website for redesign, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and finally delivering the final redesign.

The project is divided into three main phases, each represented by a separate Git branch:

	1.	Selecting a Website to Redesign

	2.	Low-Fidelity Prototype

	3.	High-Fidelity Prototype

Each phase has its relevant files, including PDFs and Figma links.

Branches

1. Selecting a Website to Redesign

In this phase, I analyzed the Jump Books website and identified usability issues based on guidelines. The issues were documented, and this branch contains the PDF report for the selection and analysis of the website.

2. Low-Fidelity Prototype

After analyzing the website, I created a low-fidelity prototype using Figma. This is the initial draft to help visualize the basic layout and structure of the redesigned website.

3. High-Fidelity Prototype
   
The high-fidelity prototype is a more detailed and interactive version of the redesign, created using Figma. It includes actual colors, fonts, and layout changes that improve the website’s usability and aesthetics.

	•	Figma File

How to Access the Files

	•	Assignment 1, Part 1, Group 1: Download the PDF from the Assignment1_Part1_Group1.pdf file on the Selecting a Website to Redesign branch.

	•	Assignment 1, Part 2, Group 1: Download the PDF from the Assignment1_Part2_Group1.pdf file on the Low-Fidelity Prototype branch.

	•	Assignment 1, Part 3, Group 1: Download the PDF from the Assignment1_Part3_Group1.pdf file on the High-Fidelity Prototype branch. You can also access the Figma file and view the interactive prototype via the provided links.

Technologies Used

	•	Figma: For designing the prototypes (Low-Fidelity & High-Fidelity).


Future Improvements

	•	Expansion of functionality and responsiveness for mobile devices.

	•	User testing and feedback to refine the design further.

	•	Improved navigation and categorization for better user experience.

Notes:

	•	This project focuses on the design aspects of the JumpBooks website, with an emphasis on improving usability and user experience.

	•	The Figma files allow for collaboration and can be further expanded or altered based on user feedback.
